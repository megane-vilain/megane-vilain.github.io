Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.
Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources plus ensure OCI image supply chain security. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Implementation
Kyverno runs as a dynamic admission controller in a Kubernetes cluster. Kyverno receives validating and mutating admission webhook HTTP callbacks from the kube-apiserver and applies matching policies to return results that enforce admission policies or reject requests.

Policy enforcement is captured using Kubernetes events. Kyverno also reports policy violations for existing resources.

The picture below shows the high-level architecture for Kyverno:

## Policies

A policy is a collection of rules which consists of the following

There is two kinds of policy

- ClusterPolicy -> Applies to cluster wide ressources
- Policy  -> Will only apply to resources within the namespace in which they are defined
