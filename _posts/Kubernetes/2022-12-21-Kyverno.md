Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.
Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes resources plus ensure OCI image supply chain security. The Kyverno CLI can be used to test policies and validate resources as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

# Implementation
Kyverno runs as a dynamic admission controller in a Kubernetes cluster. Kyverno receives validating and mutating admission webhook HTTP callbacks from the kube-apiserver and applies matching policies to return results that enforce admission policies or reject requests.

Policy enforcement is captured using Kubernetes events. Kyverno also reports policy violations for existing resources.

The picture below shows the high-level architecture for Kyverno:

# Policies

A policy is a collection of rules which consists of the following
![image tooltip here](/assets/images/kyverno-policy-structure.png)


There is two kinds of policy

- ClusterPolicy -> Applies to cluster wide ressources
- Policy  -> Will only apply to resources within the namespace in which they are defined

## Global settings
Common settings which appliy to all rules in the policy

### validationFailureAction
Controls if a validation policy rule should block the admission review request.

- enforce -> block the admission 
- audit -> allow the admission but report the policy failure in a policy report (Default value)

### background
Controls if rules are applied to existing resources during a background scan. Default value *true*

A policy using wildcards in match or exclude is not allowed in background mode.


## Select ressources

It is possible to match and exclude ressources from the policy.
They have the same structure and each can contain only one the following attributes

|||
|---|---|
|*any*|Logical operator **OR** |
|*all*|Logical operator **AND**|


### Ressources filters

#### ressources
Select ressources by names, namespaces, kinds, label selectors, annotations, and namespace selectors.
Kind attribute is mandatory.
#### subjects
Select users, user groups, and service accounts
#### roles
Select namespaced roles
#### clusterRoles 
Select cluster wide roles
