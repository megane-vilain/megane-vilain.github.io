 A pod is the smallest unit of K8S. It's an abstraction over a container.

 Usually meant to run only 1 application container per pod. 

 Each pod gets it's own private IP address and can communicate with each other.
 Pods are ephemeral and can die due to multiple reasons. They will get new ip adress on pod restart.


 ## Create a pod


 ### CLI
 

 Easiest way to create a pod is to use this command.

 This command will create a pod with a container from the nginx image.

``` bash
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx
```

### With manifest

Pods are more often created from a manifest file like the one below (yaml)

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1 #Define the kube api version
kind: Pod # The kind of object we're creating
metadata:
  name: mon-pod # Name of the pod
spec: # Describe the configuration of the pod
  containers: # List of containers for the pod
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080 # Define the exposed port inside the container
```

To create a pod with a manifest file

``` bash
kubectl apply -f my-pod.yaml
```

### Kubectl commands

``` 
kubectl get pods
```
{: title="returns the list of pods with information about their states"}
