In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector (label). 
A Service in Kubernetes is a REST object, similar to a Pod. Like all of the REST objects, you can POST a Service definition to the API server to create a new instance. 

For example, suppose you have a set of Pods where each listens on TCP port 9376 and contains a label **app.kubernetes.io/name=MyApp:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376

```
