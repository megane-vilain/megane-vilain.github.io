# Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. Google originally designed Kubernetes, but the Cloud Native Computing Foundation now maintains the project.

## Control plane
The Kubernetes master node handles the Kubernetes control plane of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting high-availability clusters.
The various components of the Kubernetes control plane are as follows:

### Etcd
Persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store. It stores the configuration data of the cluster. 
### Api server
Serves the kubernetes api using JSON over HTTP, which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes. The API server processes and validates REST request and update the state of the API objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers accros workers nodes. The api server uses etcd's watch API to monitor the cluster, roll out critical configuration changes. As an example, the deployer may specify that three instances of a particular "pod" need to be running. etcd stores this fact. If the Deployment Controller finds that only two instances are running (conflicting with the etcd declaration), it schedules the creation of an additional instance of that pod.

### Scheduler
Extensible component that selects on which node an unschedules pod runds, based on ressource availability. The scheduler tracks ressouce use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. His role is to match resource "supply" to workload "demand"

### Controller
Reconciliation loop that drives the actual cluster state toward the desired state, communicating with the API server to create, update and delete the resources it manages. One kind of controller is a Replication controller, which handes replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails. Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernets system include a DaemonSett Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine, and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion, as part of a batch job.

### Controller manager
Process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers.
