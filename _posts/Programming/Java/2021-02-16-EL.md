JSP Expression Language (EL) makes it possible to easily access application data stored in JavaBeans components. JSP EL allows you to create expressions both (a) arithmetic and (b) logical.

### Example
```jsp
${expr + 7}
```

## Basic Operators in EL

|Attribute|Description|
|--|--|
|**.**|Access a bean property or Map entry|
|**[]**|Access an array or List element
|**()**|Group a subexpression to change the evaluation order (arithmetic)|
|**+**|Addition|
|**-**|Substraction or negation of value|
|*|Multiplication|
|**/ or div**|Division
|**% or mod**|Modulo
|**== or eq**|Test for equality
|**!= or ne**|Test for inequality
|**< or lt**|Test for less than
|**> or gt**|Test for greater than
|**<= or le**|Test for less than or equal
|**>= or ge**|Test for greater than or equal
|**&& or and**|Test for logical AND
|**|| or or**|Test for logical OR
|**! or not**|Unary Boolean complement
|**empty**|Test for empty variable values

## Functions in JSP EL

JSP EL allows you to use functions in expressions as well. These functions must be defined in the custom tag libraries.
A function usage has the following syntax 
```jsp
${ns:func(param1, param2, ...)}
```
Where ns is the namespace of the function, func is the name of the function and param1 is the first parameter value. For example, the function fn:length, which is part of the JSTL library. This function can be used as follows to get the length of a string.

To use a function from any tag library (standard or custom), you must install that library on your server and must include the library in your JSP using the <taglib> directive

### Example
```jsp
<%@ taglib uri="jstl-functions" prefix="fn"%>
```
