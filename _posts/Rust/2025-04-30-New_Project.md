## Compile a rust file with rustc

Using this example file main.rs
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
You can compile the file by using the following command
```console
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

Depending on the OS, it will create a main or main.exe file. It's necessary to execute the file after the compilation process

## Project creation with Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. 

```shell
$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
```

To create a project from an existing folder, run the following command instead

```shell 
cargo init
```

### Important files generated by cargo

- Cargo.toml -> Project configuration file which defines metadata, dependencies and optional features
- src folder and main.rs file
- .gitignore file

#### Initial Cargo.toml
```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]

```

### Check the code to make sure it compiles

```
cargo check 
```

### Build the projet
Compile the project and creates the excutuable file in  target/debug/hello_cargo. 
Default build is debug, to create a release file, you need to use the flag --release (It will take longer to compile)

```shell
cargo build
```

### Run the project 
Compile and run the project for us 

```
cargo run 
```
